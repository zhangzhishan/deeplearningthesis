  Abstract                 = {{The space-fractional diffusion equation models anomalous
 super-diffusion. Its solutions are transition densities of a stable Levy
 motion, representing the accumulation of power-law jumps. The tempered
 stable Levy motion uses exponential tempering to cool these jumps. A
 tempered fractional diffusion equation governs the transition densities,
 which progress from super-diffusive early-time to diffusive late-time
 behavior. This article provides finite difference and particle tracking
 methods for solving the tempered fractional diffusion equation with
 drift. A temporal and spatial second-order Crank-Nicolson method is
 developed, based on a finite difference formula for tempered fractional
 derivatives. A new exponential rejection method for simulating tempered
 Levy stables is presented to facilitate particle tracking codes. (C)

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider spectral approximation of fractional differential equations (FDEs). A main ingredient of our approach is to define a new class of generalized Jacobi functions (GJFs), which is intrinsically related to fractional calculus, and can serve as natural basis functions for properly designed spectral methods for FDEs. We establish spectral approximation results for these GJFs in weighted Sobolev spaces involving fractional derivatives. We construct efficient GJF-Petrov-Galerkin methods for a class of prototypical fractional initial value problems (FIVPs) and fractional boundary value problems (FBVPs) of general order, and show that with an appropriate choice of the parameters in GJFs, the resulted linear systems can be sparse and well-conditioned. Moreover, we derive error estimates with convergence rate only depending on the smoothness of data, so truly spectral accuracy can be attained if the data are smooth enough. The idea and results presented in this paper will be useful to deal with more general FDEs associated with Riemann-Liouville or Caputo fractional derivatives.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper is devoted to the construction and analysis of finite difference methods for solving a class of time-fractional subdiffusion equations. Based on the certain superconvergence at some particular points of the fractional derivative by the traditional first-order Gr\"unwald-Letnikov formula, some effective finite difference schemes are derived. The obtained schemes can achieve the global second-order numerical accuracy in time, which is independent of the values of anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha( 0 < \alpha < 1 )$ in the governing equation. The spatial second-order scheme and the spatial fourth-order compact scheme, respectively, are established for the one-dimensional problem along with the strict analysis on the unconditional stability and convergence of these schemes by the discrete energy method. Furthermore, the extension to the two-dimensional case is also considered. Numerical experiments support the correctness of the theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the new developed difference schemes. },

In this article, the reproducing kernel theory is applied to solve a kind of nonlinear fractional order Volterra integro-differential equation. The fraction derivatives are described in Caputo sense. In order to solve this kind of equation, we discuss and derive the approximate solution in the form of series with easily computable terms in the reproducing kernel space, by introducing a simple algorithm to implement this process. Some numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique. },

  Abstract                 = {Fractional advection-dispersion equations are used in groundwater hydrology to model the transport of passive tracers carried by fluid flow in a porous medium. In this paper we develop practical numerical methods to solve one dimensional fractional advection-dispersion equations with variable coefficients on a finite domain. The practical application of these results is illustrated by modeling a radial flow problem. Use of the fractional derivative allows the model equations to capture the early arrival of tracer observed at a field site. },

These fractional equations are derived asymptotically from basic random walk models, and from a generalised master equation. Several physical consequences are discussed which are relevant to dynamical processes in complex systems. Methods of solution are introduced and for some special cases exact solutions are calculated. This report demonstrates that fractional equations have come of age as a complementary tool in the description of anomalous transport processes. },

More specifically, we investigate the computational aspects of the Galerkin approximation using continuous piecewise polynomial basis functions on a regular triangulation of the domain. The computational challenges of approximating the solution to fractional differential equations using the finite element method stem from the fact that a fractional differential operator is a non-local operator. Several numerical examples are given which demonstrate approximations to FADEs. },

  Abstract                 = {We study a generalization of the standard trapping problem of random walk theory in which particles move subdiffusively on a one-dimensional lattice. We consider the cases in which the lattice is filled with a one-sided and a two-sided random distribution of static absorbing traps with concentration c. The survival probability 桅(t) that the random walker is not trapped by time t is obtained exactly in both versions of the problem through a fractional diffusion approach. Comparison with simulation results is made. },
